    <p class="item">Animal Crossing city folk came out in 2008 for the Wii Which is an older animal crossing game but it was better because unlike the newer games the villagers have more personality, and you could get on and get insulted by talking animals which in the newer games is toned back alot more or completely taken out which makes them more bland even though they have more features and better graphics which is why Animal Crossing city folk is good despite how old it is conpared to the newer ones.</p>
